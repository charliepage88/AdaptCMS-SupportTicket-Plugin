# Support Tickets

Support Tickets let you use a simple system for users to submit issues on your site. You can respond back to them and vice-versa, users can attach files to help you troubleshoot problems and you can manage tickets in the admin panel.

## Installation

To install, first download the zip and unpack the folder 'SupportTicket' into your 'app/Old_Plugins' folder - be sure to chmod this new folder to 755. Then login into your admin panel and click on 'Manage Plugins'. You should see this plugin listed and an option to install on the right side.
Simply click that and click continue on the install and everything should be done!
